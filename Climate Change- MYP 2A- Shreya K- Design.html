<b> What Is Climate Change? </b>
<br>
<ul> <li> Climate change refers to the change in the environmental conditions of the earth. This happens due to many internal and external factors. The climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades. Besides, these climatic changes affect life on the earth in various ways. The climate started changing a long time ago due to human activities but we came to know about it in the last century. During the last century, we started noticing the climatic change and its effect on human life. </ul> </li>

<b> Whats the Big Deal? Why Is Climate Change Even Important? </b>
<br>
<ul> <li> Climate affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our food sources to our transport infrastructure, from what clothes we wear, to where we go on holiday. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future. It’s important that we understand how the climate is changing, so that we can prepare for the future. Studying the climate helps us predict how much rain the next winter might bring, or how far sea levels will rise due to warmer sea temperatures. </ul> </li>
<br>
	<br>
<ul> <li> We can also see which regions are most likely to be affected by extreme weather, or which wildlife species are threatened by climate change. We are seeing changes that have never been seen before. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice have diminished, and sea levels have risen. Climate change may aggravate erosion, decline in organic matter, salinization, soil biodiversity loss, landslides, desertification and flooding. The effect of climate change on soil carbon storage can be related to changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. </ul> </li>

<b> How Is Climate Change Affecting Us and Our Lives </b>
<ul> 
	<br>
	<li> Humans and wild animals face new challenges for survival because of climate change. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people’s livelihoods and communities. 
		<br>
				<br>
						<br>
	 <li> The main threats of climate change, stemming from the rising temperature of Earth's atmosphere include rising sea levels, ecosystem collapse and more frequent and severe weather. Rising temperatures from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions affects planet-wide systems in various ways. 
		<br>
				<br>
						<br>
		<li> In addition to altering plant communities, the study predicts climate change will disrupt the ecological balance between interdependent and often endangered plant and animal species, reduce biodiversity and adversely affect Earth's water, energy, carbon and other element cycles.
 </li>

<b> How Can We Reduce Climate Change? </b>
	<br>
		<br>
<ul> <li> Our lifestyles have a profound impact on our planet. Our choices matter. Around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to private households. The energy, food, and transport sectors each contribute about 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions. 
	<br>
		<br>
<li> From the electricity we use, to the food we eat and the way we travel, we can make a difference. Here are some important ways, we indivisuals can help the cause of climate change: <br>  </li>
